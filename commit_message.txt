fix: Use cmake.install() in package() method

Replaced manual file copying in the `package()` method of `conanfile.py`
with `cmake.install()`. This leverages CMake's built-in install rules
for the xlnt library, ensuring that the library files are correctly
placed in the Conan package, which should resolve the 'Library not found'
error during the test_package build.
