fix: Resolve NameError for cmake in package() method

Moved the initialization of the CMake object to `self.cmake` in the
`build()` method and updated the `package()` method to use `self.cmake.install()`.
This ensures that the `cmake` object is properly defined and accessible
within the `package()` method, resolving the `NameError` encountered
during the Conan package creation.
